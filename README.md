**Please be aware that this implementation is a proof of concept. Don't expect everything to work!**

# Installation

When it comes to the installation, you have two options:
- Option 1: Install via HACS
- Option 2: Manual Installation

## Option 1: Install via HACS

First, navigate to the HACS tab on your Home Assistant instance. On this page, click the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories":
<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/install/install-step-1.png" width=1200  alt="install-step-1"/>
</p>


In the floating window, please enter the link to the repository and select "Integration" as the type. (Just copy the link from the browser as shown)

</p>


After clicking the "Add" button, the repository should be added at the top as follows:

</p>


Next, search for your recently added repository in the HACS search bar and click on it:
<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/install/install-step-4.png" width=1200  alt="install-step-4"/>
</p>


Click the "Download" button in the bottom right:
<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/install/install-step-5.png" width=1200  alt="install-step-5"/>

### CONGRATULATIONS <3

You have successfully added the integration to your Home Assistant instance.


## Option 2: Manual Installation

Install it as you would do with any Home Assistant custom component:

1. Download the `custom_components` folder from the repository.
2. Copy the `samsung_familyhub_fridge` directory into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant installation. The `custom_components` directory resides within your Home Assistant configuration directory.</br>
**Note**: if the `custom_components` directory does not exist, you need to create it.
After a correct installation, your configuration directory should look like the following:
    ```
    └── ...
    └── configuration.yaml
    └── custom_components
        └── samsung_familyhub_fridge
            └── __init__.py
            └── manifest.json
            └── api.py
            └── camera.py
            └── ...
    ```
